# Air Quality & Green Cover Prediction for U.S. Cities

This project analyzes the relationship between urban green cover (trees, parks) and air quality (AQI) for selected U.S. cities. 
It demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, multiple regression and a simple forecasting scenario to estimate AQI improvements under increased green cover.

## Features
- Simulated U.S. city-level AQI and green cover dataset
- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Multiple linear regression to assess green cover effect on AQI
- Simple scenario forecasting for AQI improvement by 2030
- Visualizations and summary of results

## Tools
- Python (pandas, numpy, statsmodels, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
